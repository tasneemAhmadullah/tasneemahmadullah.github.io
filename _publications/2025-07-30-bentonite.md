Abstract: This study presents the first kinetic model to predict the solid and pore solution composition of Na-bentonite clay reacting with slaked lime over a period of 720 days. The model successfully accounts for most experimental data using a single kinetic rate constant. The following sequence of reactions was predicted by the model: initial rapid dissolution of portlandite within the first 7 days, leading to a decrease in pH and dissolved calcium, and concurrent formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H: jennite), calcium aluminate hydrate (C-A-H: C₄AH₁₃), calcium aluminosilicate hydrates (stratlingite) and hydrotalcite. After 7 days, jennite and stratlingite are predicted to transform into tobermorite-II, contributing to strength development up to 28 days. From 28 to 90 days, continued montmorillonite dissolution is predicted, along with minor formation of ettringite, partial tobermorite-II dissolution, and precipitation of secondary phases such as albite and talc. Experimentally, portlandite dissolution was confirmed by TGA and XRD and found to be complete within 7 days, in agreement with model predictions. However, other predicted solid-phase transformations (e.g., tobermorite-II formation and dissolution, ettringite, albite, and talc formation) could not be conclusively verified through experimental techniques. Aqueous phase measurements confirmed that the pH and Ca trends in solution, and that equilibrium was reached by 90 days.
