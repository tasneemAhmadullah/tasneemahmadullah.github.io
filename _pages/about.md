I am a postdoctoral researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) investigating the complexities of environmental soil systems. My research combines advanced spectroscopic and spectrometric analysis of soil samples with biogeochemical and geochemical modeling to develop solutions for critical environmental challenges.

I completed my Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 2023, where my dissertation examined reaction kinetics and strength development in lime-stabilized clay soils under the supervision of Dr. Maria Chrysochoou .

My work bridges experimental analytical techniques with computational modeling to enhance our understanding of soil-environmental interactions and contribute to sustainable environmental management practices.
