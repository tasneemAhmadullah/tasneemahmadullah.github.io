I am a postdoctoral researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) focusing in understanding the complexities of environmental soil systems. My expertise lies in spectroscopic and spectrometric analysis of soil samples, bridging experimental data with biogeochemical and geochemical modeling to address critical environmental challenges. I have completed my Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from University of Connecticut in 2023. My PhD thesis focused n studying reaction kinetics and stregnth development in lime stabilized clay soil supervides by Dr Maria Chrysochoou (https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/marisa-chrysochoou/)
